# Project Management Methodologies and Frameworks you should know

A **project** is an activity to meet the creation of a **unique** product or service.

The **project management methodology** provides an accurate project roadmap that outlines all the steps required to successfully complete a project and provides a comprehensive, rigid and repeatable method.

The **project management framework** provides structure and direction to the project and not too rigid and detailed as project methodology.
Frameworks are adaptable enough to deal with changing circumstances.

|:----------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------:|
|Provides a general rules how project can be implemented.   | Provides strict guidelines and procedures for finishing a project. |
| Allows a creative adaptation.                      | Rigid and restrictive.                          |
| Preferred by experts                                       | Preferred by beginners                                    |
| Makes developing and implementing performance metrics hard.| Details all performance guidelines. |
| Allows to include other practices and tools.          | Cannot be integrated with other practices and tools         |
## Basic terms
- **Project resources** are components that are necessary for successful project implementation. They include people, equipment, money, time, knowledge – basically, anything that you may require from the project planning to the project delivery phases.
 - **Project scope**-clearly identifies the goals, deadlines, and deliverables that a project is set to complete in a specific period of time.
- **Scope creep** is what happens when a project's tasks and deliverables begin to exceed the allotted project scope a project manager has set. While scope creep is not inherently bad, it can drastically shift the amount of time it takes to complete a project if not monitored and managed carefully.
- **Critical path method** (CPM) is a project management modeling tool. The project manager lists all of the project work that needs to be completed, the estimated time, and the dependencies of each of those tasks. You then measure out the project from start to finish to see the entire process of the project in one large timeline.
Time when the start of work can be postponed without affecting the overall time of the project, so the time reserve for the CPM is zero.
- **Time reserve** - time on what the start of work can be postponed without affecting the overall time of the project, thus time reserve for CPM is equal to zero.
-  **Milestone** is a scheduling process that describes the set  of related deliverables. These are the significant points in time or an event that mark important moments during the project.
- **Agile** is an iterative form of project management. Instead of working in one big chunk of work, Agile instead focuses on smaller increments so that work can quickly shift towards a different strategy if needed. This ensures that the changes made to the product are focused on what's best for the end user.
### Waterfall methodology
The **waterfall** or **traditional methodology**  is sequential and linear flow of project phases. It consists of static phases that follow one another in a certain order.
![enter image description here](https://github.com/Rayveni/blog/blob/main/articles/project%20%20methodologies&frameworks/waterfall.png?raw=true)


1.  **Requirements**  – business needs and project requirements are analyzed and documented and the final product's shape is chosen.
2.  **Design (planning)**  – make a detailed plan on how to accomplish business and project goals. Based on this data, a calendar plan, budget, risk profile , measure progress and stakeholders are defined.
3.  **Implement**  – implement the  project plan and control  progress. Testing and requirement checking.
4.  **Verification**  – compare project performance with plans and fix problems that arise
5.  **Maintenance**  – share project accomplishments with clients, get final approval, and close project

### When to Use
-   where budget, requirements, and scope are clearly defined
-   accurate work estimate is possible
-   when there is a low chance of risk( avoiding risk by having a time buffer on each stage)

### When not to Use
-   when there is no clarity about requirements and the end product
-   where requirements and industry standards change rapidly
-   when you need a working prototype in the first go
-   where you need to incorporate user feedback later down the road

## Agile

Agile is an umbrella  term for a wide range of methodologies and techniques . **Scrum, Kanban, Hybrid** and **Lean**  are the most widely used frameworks and practices.
It reduces the complexity of a project by breaking down the project cycle into smaller sub-cycles , allowing to deliver results of "mini-projects" (so-called increments) much faster and make changes with lower cost and impact on the rest of the project.
![enter image description here](https://github.com/Rayveni/blog/blob/main/articles/project%20%20methodologies&frameworks/agile.png?raw=true)
In other words agile is **art of small steps** and visualization  team work results(involvement is extremely important , with luck of it it's hard to find motivation to move ahead for team).

Agile nether methodology, nether framework -its a mindset, based  on **Agile Manifesto** (4 values and 12 principles).
The main topics that agile addresses are constant customer interaction, responding to change, and improving team interaction. 
![enter image description here](https://github.com/Rayveni/blog/blob/main/articles/project%20%20methodologies&frameworks/agile_manifesto.jpg?raw=true)

 1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer   through early and continuous delivery   of valuable software.
 2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in   development. Agile processes harness change for   the customer's competitive advantage.
 3. Deliver working software frequently, from a   couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a   preference to the shorter timescale.
 4. Business people and developers must work   together daily throughout the project.
 5.  Build projects around motivated individuals.   Give them the environment and support they need,   and trust them to get the job done.
 6. The most efficient and effective method of   conveying information to and within a development   team is face-to-face conversation.
 7.  Working software is the primary measure of progress.
 8. Agile processes promote sustainable development.The sponsors, developers, and users should be able   to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
 9. Continuous attention to technical excellence   and good design enhances agility.
 10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount   of work not done--is essential.
 11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs   emerge from self-organizing teams.
 12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how   to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts   its behavior accordingly.
 
 ### Stories, epics, and initiatives
 ![enter image description here](https://github.com/Rayveni/blog/blob/main/articles/project%20%20methodologies&frameworks/epic.jpg?raw=true)
 -   **Stories**, also called “user stories,” are short requirements or requests written from the perspective of an end user.
-   **Epics**  are large bodies of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks (called stories).
-   **Initiatives**  are collections of epics that drive toward a common goal.
#### Example of initiatives and epics
Let’s say your rocket ship company wants to decrease the cost per launch by 5% this year. That’s a great fit for an **initiative**, as no single epic could likely achieve that big of a goal. Within that initiative, there would be **epics** such as, “Decrease launch-phase fuel consumption by 1%,” “Increase launches per quarter from 3 to 4,” and “Turn all thermostats down from 71 to 69 degrees #Dadmode.”
#### Example of User Stories
-   iPhone users need access to a vertical view of the live feed when using the mobile app.
-   Desktop users need a “view fullscreen” button in the lower right hand corner of the video player.
-   Android users need to be linked to apple store.
## Kanban framework
The Kanban method is a flexible method designed for continuous improvement, flexibility in task management, and improved workflow. In this illustrative way, it is possible to see at a glance how the whole project is going.
### _The Simplest Kanban board consists of three sections:_
1.  Yet to be started (To-Do)
2.  Work in Progress (Doing)
3.  Completed Work (Done)
![enter image description here](https://github.com/Rayveni/blog/blob/main/articles/project%20%20methodologies&frameworks/kanban3.jpg?raw=true)

### Core Kanban practices
 1. **Visualize Workflow** 
 2. **Limit Works In Progress** limiting the number of tasks can discourage team from context switching and multitasking.
 3. **Continuous  Flow**  tasks pulled out from backlog in priority order, so the work never stops
 4. **Make Policies Explicit** standardizing workflow with a kanban board, helps team to understand how you expect them to do their tasks. This helps avoid cutting corners.
 6. **Implement Feedback Loops**  methods or approaches being implemented by an organization to drive continuous improvement on processes and operations.The sessions at which feedback is solicited are called a [kanban cadence](https://kanbanzone.com/2020/how-to-implement-feedback-loops-in-your-kanban-system/).
 7. **Improve Collaboratively, Improve Experimentally**

### Recommended meetings for the kanban 
-   **Daily meetings**: Daily stand-up
-   **Weekly meeting**: Replenishment meeting
-   **Bi-weekly**: Service delivery review
-   **Monthly**: Risk review, operations review
-   **Occasionally**: Delivery planning
-   **Quarterly**: Strategy review

### Basic Kanban principles
1.  **Start with existing workflow**
Kanban framework can be implemented without making dramatic changes to the existing workflow. I
2.  **Pursue elaborate change**
There will be minimal resistance from  stakeholders when small yet evolutionary process changes are actively encouraged.
3.  **Respect current roles and responsibilities**
Accepting and respecting current roles and responsibilities will foster more support for the Kanban initiative helping businesses to implement the  Kanban system more easily.
4. **Encourage leadership at all levels**
Rather than depending on team leaders or executives, Kanban reaches optimal results by making  teams stay **self-organized**.
### When to Use

 - having continuous flow work like support and services
 - frequent stakeholder engagement is not required
 - having strong and motivated team

### When not to Use
- Lack of time (strict deadlines)
- Required interaction
- Dynamic environment
## Scrum framework
The main idea behind Scrum is that the process of product development is broken up into relatively short and fixed-duration iterations called _sprints_ during which a team creates one piece of software (an increment) that is potentially releasable.
A distinctive feature of this framework is that there is no heavy planning at the beginning and a Scrum team can start coding once it receives enough information to complete the first incremental release. After the first increment is built, a team tests and reviews it to make this specific piece of software) ready for delivery. Hence, at the end of the sprint, a client receives a potentially shippable feature set. The same procedure (_planning → building → testing → reviewing = increment_) is repeated for all future sprints until a product is complete.
![enter image description here](https://github.com/Rayveni/blog/blob/main/articles/project%20%20methodologies&frameworks/scrum.jpg?raw=true)
###  Scrum roles
-  **Product owner**
Product owners are visionaries who ensure that the team and scrum masterwork on goals that are aligned seamlessly with the business goal. They spend more time with the stakeholders and clients. They focus more on the end result than the mode of implementation.
- **Scrum master** 
Similar to a project manager, every scrum master ensures the enforcement of the scrum framework and focuses on facilitating  team management. Unlike project managers, scrum masters don’t manage people as it goes against agile principles.
-  **Team members**
Being inherently cross-functional, team members handle everything from analysis to execution and verification. Members of a  scrum team  are highly self-organized and so they perform efficiently without any supervision.

### Scrum process
The heart of Scrum is a **Sprint**, a time-box of two weeks or one month during which a potentially releasable product increment is created. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint. Sprints consist of the Sprint planning, daily scrums, the development work, the Sprint review, and the Sprint retrospective.

-   **In Sprint planning,** the work to be performed in the Sprint is planned collaboratively by the Scrum Team.
   -   **The Daily Scrum Meeting** is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Scrum Team to synchronize the activities and create a plan for that day.   
-   **A Sprint Review** is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and make changes to the Product Backlog, if needed.
-  **The Sprint Retrospective** occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning. In this meeting, the Scrum Team is to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the subsequent Sprint.
![enter image description here](https://github.com/Rayveni/blog/blob/main/articles/project%20%20methodologies&frameworks/scrum1.jpg?raw=true)

**Scrum poker** or **planning poker** is a consensus based, gamified technique to estimate the complexity and effort of a software feature. After presenting the feature, each member of the team picks a vote from different ranges of card sets. The vote remains hidden until all members have voted to avoid influence from other team members. After everyone has voted the highest and lowest estimates explain their choice and the process is repeated until the team agrees on a value.

### When to use
- Hight requirements uncertainly
- Innovation project
- low time to market required

### When not to use
- Your environment isn’t complex
- no self-organized team
- impossible to increment

## Lean 
Lean is not a methodology or framework ,it's a philosophy(mindset).
![enter image description here](https://github.com/Rayveni/blog/blob/main/articles/project%20%20methodologies&frameworks/lean.jpg?raw=true)
In short, **Lean**  is a way of optimizing the people, resources, effort, and energy of your organization toward creating value for the customer. It is based on two guiding tenets, **continuous improvement** and **respect for people**(sounds close to agile?-) ). 
**Lean** focuses on eliminating waste from key processes to continuously be impacting positively on the value stream. It does this by optimizing separate technologies, assets and verticals.
### purpose, process, and people
Endlessly address fundamental questions
1.  What is the value-driven purpose? Or what is the problem to solve?
2.  What is the work to be done (to solve the problem)?
3.  What capabilities are required (to do the work to solve the problem)?
4.  What management system — operating system and leadership behaviors — is required?
5.  What basic thinking, including mindsets and assumptions, are required by the organization as a purpose-driven socio-technical system?
### Lean definition of  waste:
-   **Motion**: Unnecessary movement of people or processes (equipment and manufacturing machinery, for example). Repetitive movements that do not add value translates to wasted time and resources.
-   **Over-processing**: Doing unnecessary processes or steps than what is required to create a valuable product.
-   **Extra-processing**: Products require more work or quality than necessary to deliver value to the customer.
-   **Defects**: Manufacturing processes create defective products — which becomes wasted materials.
-   **Transport**: Like motion, but over greater distances to include the transport of tools, inventory, people, or products further than necessary.
-   **Human Potential**: Underused skills and talent due to poor  employee management  and team structure lead to a lack of morale and productivity.
-   **Waiting**: Idle equipment and waiting on materials or equipment can slow down processes and efficiency.
-   **Inventory**: Excessive products and inventory take up space, reveal overproduction, and create backwork.
### Lean cycle
 1.  **Identify Value**
 The value lies in the problem you are trying to solve for the customer. More specifically, in the part of the solution that your customer is actively willing to pay.
 2. **Value Stream Mapping**
  Including all actions and people involved in delivering the end product to the customer. 
 3.  **Create Continuous Workflow**
  Breaking up work into smaller batches and visualizing the workflow.
 4.  **Create a Pull System**
Having a stable workflow guarantees that your teams can deliver work tasks much faster with less effort. However, in order to secure a stable workflow, make sure to create a **pull system**. In such a system, the work is pulled only if there is a demand for it. 
5.  **Continuous Improvement**
Your system is not isolated and static. Problems may occur at any of the previous steps. This is why you need to make sure that employees on every level are involved in continuously improving the process.

### When to use
- Hight quality and excision required on all project phases
-   **You experience frequent product launch delays.** According to [one Gartner survey](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-09-09-gartner-survey-finds-that-45-percent-of-product-launches-are-delayed-by-at-least-one-month), 45% of product launches are delayed by at least a month. This creates a poor customer experience and gives your brand a bad reputation, which will damage your bottom line over time.
-   **Your team is burnt out.** Lean product development makes better use of your resources, and that includes your people. A learning environment can also stimulate and motivate your team to push through difficult times together.
-   **You have knowledge gaps.**  Because of its emphasis on learning, lean product development can bridge knowledge gaps and empower your team with more information and skills. When you’re trying to nail down customer value for every new feature you release, these gaps can be potentially disastrous.
### When not to use
-  for big and heterogeneous projects
- risks of deadline shift
## Six sigma
Six Sigma is a method that offers organizations tools to improve their capabilities in managing their businesses. This increase in performance and decreasing process variation, it is possible to reduce defect rates, improve employee morale, and improve the quality of products or services, which all contribute to a higher level of profitability.
![enter image description here](https://github.com/Rayveni/blog/blob/main/articles/project%20%20methodologies&frameworks/six_sigma.jpg?raw=true)
### Key principles
1.  **Focus on the Customer**
    The primary goal is to bring maximum benefit to the customer..
2.    **Measure the Value Stream and Find Your Problem**
     Map the steps in a given process to determine areas of waste. Gather data to discover the specific problem area that is to be addressed or transformed. Have clearly defined goals for  **data collection**, including defining the data to be collected, the reason for the data gathering, insights expected, ensuring the accuracy of measurements, and establishing a standardized data collection system.  Ask questions and find the **root cause**.
3. **Get Rid of the Junk**
     Once the problem is identified, make changes to the process to eliminate variation, thus removing defects. Remove the activities in the process that do not add to the customer value. If the value stream doesn't reveal where the problem lies, tools are used to help discover the outliers and problem areas. Streamline functions to achieve quality control and efficiency. In the end, by taking out the above-mentioned junk, bottlenecks in the process are removed.
4.  **Keep the Ball Rolling**
Involve all stakeholders. Adopt a structured process where your team contributes and collaborates their varied expertise for problem-solving.  
5.   **Ensure a Flexible and Responsive Ecosystem**
    The essence of Six Sigma is business transformation and change. When a faulty or inefficient process is removed, it calls for a change in the work practice and employee approach. A robust culture of flexibility and responsiveness to changes in procedures can ensure streamlined project implementation. The people and departments involved should be able to adapt to change with ease, so to facilitate this, processes should be designed for quick and seamless adoption. Ultimately, the company that has an eye fixed on the data examines the bottom line periodically and adjusts its processes where necessary, can gain a competitive edge.

### DMAIC and DMADV 

**DMAIC**  framework is used to improve an existing business process.
**DMADV**  framework is used to create new processes in order to achieve customer needs.

Both DMAIC and DMADV help the organization to achieve the following essential goals:

-   Reduce the number of defects t
-   Find quality-related solutions to problems using data and statistical tools;
-   Meet financial and business objectives.

**DMAIC is the acronym for:**
**D**  –  **Define**  the objective of the project, create the team who will complete the task, select the process the team will be improving, identify and measure the impact the problem has on the customer.

**M**  –  **Measure**  the performance of the process by creating and executing a data collection plan that provides reliable and significant data. Identify the variance that needs to be eliminated in order to improve the business process.

**A**  –  **Analyze**  the collected data and identify possible causes of the problem. In this phase, the team is able to quantify the financial benefit of solving the problem.

**I**  –  **Improve**. Now that the problem has been identified, it is incumbent upon the team to find a solution to improve and optimize the business process. The team then tests this proposed solution to see if it is effective and financially viable.

**C**  –  **Control**. In this phase, the team documents the new solution that they have created so that it can be passed on to process owners. The project team then implements the solution according to the timeline and key milestones they have developed. Once the solution has been implemented, the project team monitors it for several months and if it meets performance expectations turns it over to the process owner.

**DMADV is the acronym for:**

**D**  –  **Define**  design goals that are consistent with customer demands and the enterprise strategy.

**M**  –  **Measure**  and identify CTQs (characteristics that are Critical To Quality), measure product capabilities, production process capability, and measure risks.

**A**  –  **Analyze**  to develop and design alternatives

**D**  –  **Design**  a business model that helps meet the customer’s needs

**V**  –  **Verify**  that the new business model helps meet the customer’s needs, set up pilot runs, implement the production process and hand it over to the process owners.

### When to use
- in extremely large organizations
### When not to use
- single project (non repeatable)
##  SAFe framework
Scaled Agile Framework is  a combination of Agile methods.
![enter image description here](https://github.com/Rayveni/blog/blob/main/articles/project%20%20methodologies&frameworks/safe.jpg?raw=true)
1. **Team layer**
 The entry level, SCRUM is almost conventional, with teams of 3–9 people, including the Product Owner, working in typical two or three-week sprints with typical scrum rituals. **Difference**: team stops being an independent module that can operate completely on its own. And the sprint stops being a standalone period of time with a complete life cycle. **Program Increments**, which typically contain 5 sprints, are made up of combined sprints. I. e. in traditional SCRUM, if the client is unhappy with the product, we make changes in the following sprint. In **SAFe**, however, we continue to move in the wrong direction until the end of the Program Increment, or in the worst case, the following 4 sprints (of course, I exaggerate).
 2.  **Release layer**
 New roles are created to manage the five sprint segments, including the **system architect** (who owns the architecture), the product manager (who manages the product, not the Product Owner; the latter seeks advice from the PM), and the RTE, the same PMP from the bygone era of waterfall. Specifically, the board, the method of assigning priorities, and generally, the idea of measuring the historical performance of teams (velocity) and projecting what will be built at the end of the time interval—as opposed to the approach with estimates and the assignment of deadlines for the already fixed functionality (scope)—are applied here. Kanban is a method for organizing work that emphasizes flow. One of the innovations is that the last sprint out of five is designated organizational, and during it large meetings are held (involving all teams and at least 100 people), technical debt is analyzed, plans are made to work out the architecture, and work is coordinated across all teams.
 3. **Coordination between departments, directors, and the client.** 
 However, the same Kanban tools are still used, with more Lean Agile influences. Here, the economic viability of changes is examined. Ideally, any changes undergo a preliminary analysis where a quantifiable hypothesis is put forth about the impending change (for instance, if we move an online store from the datacenter to the cloud, then quickly increasing capacity at the peak of seasonal sales we can increase the number of transactions by 10%) and then this hypothesis is either confirmed or not. This might be the last floor for businesses with revenues under $1 billion. Here, 12- to 36-month work plans are also developed.
 4. **Portfolio management** 
 . Amounts are allocated to various business sectors. In order to choose the directions from which you can earn a return, lean portfolio management is used, taking into account the company's development strategy. Decisions regarding the acquisition or merger of other businesses are made here. opening new business lines and shutting down existing ones. As opposed to quarterly or annual plans, the budget is regularly revised. A set of metrics that are more or less standardized is established for each portfolio component, and each is then assessed using those metrics. There are specific rituals for synchronization every two weeks (typically), where statuses and key indicators are exchanged, just like on the previous three levels. 
### When to use
- in extremely large organizations 

##  PRINCE2 methodology
![enter image description here](https://github.com/Rayveni/blog/blob/main/articles/project%20%20methodologies&frameworks/prince2.jpg?raw=true)
* PRINCE2 stands for **Pr**ojects **IN** **C**ontrolled **E**nvironments and is a structured certified methodology. It was initially created by the UK government for IT projects.  
### Key principles
1.  **Continually justify business**: Projects must be viable. This means performing a cost assessment and clearly defining all benefits to justify the project’s viability. Organizations should discontinue nonviable projects and periodically reevaluate viable projects for continued justification.
2.  **Learn from lessons**: At the beginning of the project, gather and examine the information from previous project outcomes for lessons learned. As the project moves through the various stages, continue this examination as you learn new lessons.
3.  **Define the organizational structure**: Clearly define the organizational structure so everyone involved can see and understand their roles and responsibilities.
4.  **Break down into stages**: Break down the project into clearly defined stages, with each stage carefully planned and monitored. How stages break down may vary, but specific deliverables may indicate natural breaking points.
5.  **Have an exception plan**: In general, the project manager stays out of the way unless project metrics (cost, time, etc. ) deviate from established standards. This makes it possible for the group to work effectively and independently.
6.  **Focus on quality**: Emphasize the quality of deliverables or products instead of focusing on the process at the expense of the outcomes.
7.  **Tailor to suit project needs**: Because each project varies in  scope  and size, tailor the methodology to meet each project’s specific needs.
### PRINCE2 roles
![enter image description here](https://github.com/Rayveni/blog/blob/main/articles/project%20%20methodologies&frameworks/prince2team.jpg?raw=true)
### PRINCE2 key processes 
1. **Starting the project**
Someone submits a project mandate,  requesting the project,  and indicating project goals. Members of the project board and the project manager may gather information and prepare an initial plan outline.
 2. **Directing the project**
The project board convenes to assess project justification. At this point, they may perform a  cost-benefit analysis  to determine the project’s viability. If deemed viable, the board then develops a more concrete project plan that the project manager further breaks down. As an example, consider a toy company assessing the project of developing a new toy design. Part of assessing viability would include determining production costs, evaluating how moving resources toward the new product affects other product lines, and assessing potential market interest in the new product.
3. **Initiating the project**
The process of  project initiation  is where the major  project planning  takes place. A project manager establishes project teams and team leaders, breaks down roles within each team, and specifies budgets and  timelines  to go along with each task. The project manager also establishes project metrics, procedures, and outcomes, and prepares necessary documentation. At the end of the project initiation, all project stages are well-defined and the project work is ready to begin.
For example, imagine a hospital initiates a project that involves a new streamlined check-in procedure. The project manager will need to determine which hospital departments these changes will affect, specify teams to design any necessary forms or tools for the new procedure, and pick teams to develop a plan for training employees on the new procedure. Indicate a timeline for rollout, considering how to smooth the transition, and specify metrics by which to assess outcomes.
4. **Controlling stages**
At each project stage, the project manager assesses progress and intervenes as necessary if the project exceeds the predetermined tolerances. Team leaders may report problems or request changes to plans as needed, and the project manager is responsible for approving adjustments and bringing concerns to the attention of the project board.
Suppose an aerospace manufacturer has taken on the project of developing a new electronic component. Due to supply chain issues, they cannot easily source a part they planned on using in the design, and they have to start over. This gets reported to the project manager, who adjusts the timeline for that stage of development.
5. **Managing delivery of the project**
While the project manager focuses on controlling project stages, team managers focus on direct execution of work and quality assurance of final  project deliverables. They report results to the project manager, who consolidates information and reports to the project board.
As an example, imagine a food processing plant creates a new frozen vegetable medley as a product. Quality assurance of the product may involve focus group taste-testing and health and safety checks.
6.  **Managing stage boundaries**
After each stage, the organization assesses outcomes and product quality, extracts lessons learned, and adjusts plans as needed. Reviews occur at the team, project management, and project board levels. The board makes any final decisions about whether to move to the next stage or abandon or revise the project.
Imagine an electric company creating a department focused on setting up solar energy panels in a newly purchased plot of land. After completing a project stage where they evaluated panels from different suppliers, they discover that the overall cost-effectiveness of their venture is not likely to match initial hopes. They may abandon or put the plan on hold as a result.

7.  **Closing the project**.
Once  completing the project, the project manager ties up any loose ends. This may include creating documentation, including outcomes assessments or reports to plan and justify future project stages.


**When to Use It:**  Adopted by many other countries’ governments, PRINCE2, so, as you can imagine, it’s not always suitable for smaller projects.
