Applied to Story Splitting

Simple/Obvious -

Just build it. Or, if it’s too big,
find all the stories, and do the
most valuable ones first.
--
Complicated — Find all the
stories, and do the most
valuable and/or most risky
ones first.
--
Complex — Don’t try to find all
the stories. Find one or two
that will provide some value
and teach you something
about the problem and
solution, build those and use
what you learn to find the rest.
--
Chaotic — Put out the fire;
splitting stories probably isn’t
important right now.
---
Disordered — Figure out which

domain you're in before splitting so
you don’t take the wrong approach.
