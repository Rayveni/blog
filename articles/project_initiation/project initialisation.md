# Initiation
A well-planned initiation results in a strong foundation for your project, and sets it up for success.

-   **Goals:**   determine what to do and try to achieve it.
-   **Scope**: define the work to complete the project.
-   **Deliverables**: Tangible and/or intangible products and services to deliver, typically a big part of achieving the goal
-   **Success criteria**: The criteria for measuring how successful a project was in reaching the goals.
-   **Stakeholders:** Decision makers, who determine the above four components. It is important to understand their needs and ensure that all of them agree with the goals.
-   **Resources**. Carefully consider budget, people, materials, and other items.

Finally,  goals, scope,deliverables, success criteria, stakeholders, and resources have been  established ,it's time to create a **project charter**.

A **project charter** is a document that contains all the details of the project and should be reviwed/discussed with key stakeholders  to move into the planning stage.

## Cost-benefit analysis
### Guiding questions for a cost-benefit analysis

When you’re pursuing a project, the benefits should outweigh the costs. It’s important for you and your stakeholders to consider questions like the ones that follow early on, while you prepare the proposal.

To determine the **benefits of a project,** you might ask:
-   What value will this project create?
-   How much money could this project save our organization?    
-   How much money will it bring in from existing customers? 
-   How much time will it save?
-   How will it improve the customer experience?
    

And to determine the **costs of a project**, consider questions such as:
-   How much time will people have to spend on this project?
-   What are the one-time costs?
-   Are there any ongoing costs?   
-   What about long-term costs?
    
You might also consider questions about **intangible benefits**. These are gains that are not quantifiable, such as:
-   **Customer satisfaction**. Will the project increase customer retention, causing them to spend more on the company’s products or services?
-   **Employee satisfaction**. Is the project likely to improve employee morale, reducing turnover?
-   **Employee productivity**. Will the project reduce employee’s overtime hours, saving the company money?
-   **Brand perception**. Is the project likely to improve the company’s brand perception and recognition, attracting more customers or providing a competitive advantage?
    
You can also flip these questions to consider **intangible costs**. These are costs that are not quantifiable. For example, might the project put customer retention, employee satisfaction, or brand perception at risk?

When assigning values to tangible or intangible costs and benefits, you can reference similar past projects, conduct industry research, or consult with experts.

### **Calculating costs and benefits**
**Costs**
-   **Direct costs:**  These are all the costs that are directly related to the manufacturing of the product. Such as materials, equipment, labor, etc.
-   **Indirect costs:**  Other expenses that are not directly related to the product such as rent, utilities, or transportation costs.
-   **Intangible costs:**  Any other costs that can’t be quantified, such as the brand damage if the market doesn’t respond positively to the product.
-   **Opportunity costs:**  The loss of opportunities that occurs when a decision is made instead of another. For example, you could have chosen to manufacture a product that could have been more profitable than the one you chose to make.
-   **Costs of potential risks:**  Any project is susceptible to a variety of risks. You should always consider that you might have unexpected costs at some point.

**Benefits**
-   **Direct Benefits:**  The measurable benefits in monetary value that you get from the project. In this case, the revenue, sales and profit obtained from your product.
-   **Indirect Benefits:**  Benefits that you can perceive but not necessarily measure such as increased brand awareness.
### Questions
1. **What Are the Goals and Objectives of the Project**
 Create a business case for your project and state its goals and objectives.
2.  **What Are the Alternatives?** Before you can know if the project is right, you need to compare it to similar past projects to see which is the best path forward. You can quickly check their success metrics such as their return on investment, internal rate of return, payback period and benefit-cost ratio.
3. **Who Are the Stakeholders?**
    List all stakeholders in the project. They’re the ones affected by the costs and benefits. Describe which of them are decision-makers.
5. **How Will You Measure Costs and Benefits?**
 You need to decide on the metrics you’ll use to measure all costs and benefits. Some of them will have a dollar value, while others will need other metrics.
7. **What Is the Sensitivity Analysis?**
A sensitivity analysis is a probability method used in management and business to determine how uncertainty affects your decisions, costs and profits.  
In a project management CBA, sensitivity analysis is used to determine the benefit-cost ratio of probable scenarios. You can use Excel or more specialized software to do sensitivity analyses.
8. **What Do You Do Once Your CBA Is Complete?**
The final step after collecting all this data is to make the choice that is recommended by the CBA, which is the one with the highest benefit-cost ratio.

### Return on Investment (ROI)
One common ROI formula is:
(G-C)/C=ROI
In this formula, **G** represents the financial gains you expect from the project, and **C** represents the upfront and ongoing costs of your investment in the project.

For example, imagine your project costs $6,000 up front plus $25 per month for 12 months. This equals $300 per year, but you estimate that the project will bring in $10,000 in revenue over the course of that year. Using the formula above, you calculate the ROI as: ($10,000 - $6,300) ÷ $6,300 = 0.58 = 58%

 You consider this to be a strong ROI, so you decide to pursue the project.
### other metrics

 - cost-benefit ratio (CBR) 
 -  internal rate of return (IRR)  
 - net present value (NPV)
 - payback period (PBP)
### discount rate& inflation
FV = Future Value
CV = Current Value
r = Inflation per year
n = time (years)
$FV=CV(1+r)^n$
So, $CV=\frac{FV}{(1+r)^n}$

Assume that you invest 100,000 USD in a project. You expect to earn a 10,000 USD profit after one year.
Considering yearly inflation of 5%, what will the current value be?
 $CV=\frac{10000}{(1+0.05)^1}=9523.8$


## Project goals
### SMART
-   **Specific:** The objective has no ambiguity for the project team to misinterpret.
-   **Measurable:** Metrics help the project team determine when the objective is met.
-   **Attainable:** The project team agrees the objective is realistic.
-   **Relevant:** The goal fits the organization’s strategic plan and supports the project charter.
-   **Time-bound:** The project team documents a date to achieve the goal.
In this example, your **specific** goal is to attain a  Google Career Certificate. You can make this goal **attainable** by deciding that you will complete one course per month. This goal is **relevant** because it supports your desire to make a career change. Finally, you can make this goal **time-bound** by deciding that you will complete the program within six months.

After defining each of these components, your SMART goal then becomes: Obtain a Google Career Certificate by taking one course per month within the next six months.
Be specific in your answers. For instance, the plant care app SMART goal is:

-   **Specific:** The team knows what they’re building: an app that helps users care for their plants and reminds them to do so.
-   **Measurable:** The app will be complete when it includes 100% of the plant types Office Green sells.
-   **Attainable:** The company has the knowledge, time, resources to build the app.
-   **Relevant:** Office Green’s business model relies on customers caring for their plants successfully.
-   **Time-bound:** The goal includes an 18-month timeframe.
### OKR
OKR stands for **objectives** and **key results**. They combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome.
As a project manager, OKRs can help you expand upon project goals and further clarify the deliverables you’ll need from the project to accomplish those goals. Project-level OKRs help establish the appropriate scope for your team so that you can say “no” to requests that may get in the way of them meeting their objectives.

####  OKR in project

As a project manager, creating OKRs can help you clarify both your overall project goals and the deliverables you’ll need to accomplish those goals. You can also create project-level OKRs to help motivate your team.

Strong **objectives** meet the following criteria. They are:

-   Aspirational
-   Aligned with organizational goals
-   Action-oriented
-   Concrete 
-   Significant
    
To help shape each objective, ask yourself and your team:
-   Does the objective help in achieving the project’s overall goals? 
-   Does the objective align with company and departmental OKRs    
-   Is the objective inspiring and motivational?
-   Will achieving the objective make a significant impact?

 **Develop key results**
Next, add 2–3 key results for each objective. Key results should be time-bound
Strong **key results** meet the following criteria:

-   Results-oriented—**not** a task
-   Measurable and verifiable    
-   Specific and time-bound
-   Aggressive yet realistic
### OKR development best practices

Here are some best practices to keep in mind when writing OKRs:

-   Think of your objectives as being motivational and inspiring and your key results as being tactical and specific. The objective describes what you want to do and the key results describe how you’ll know you did it.   
-   As a general rule, try to develop around 2–3 key results for each objective.  
-   Be sure to document your OKRs and link to them in your project plan.

## Scope
Scope -part of triangle (scope,budget,time), your project scope includes the boundaries of a project.
The way of definition:"an agreed upon understanding as to what is included or excluded from a project."

Make sure you understand the **_who_, _what_, _when_, _where_, _why_, and _how_**  as it applies to the scope.

- stakeholders
- goals
- deliverables
- resourses(own or contractors)
- budget(fixed or flexible)
- schedule
- flexibility (time, budget,quality)

### Scope creep
The scope of a project can get out of control quickly. **Scope creep** is when a project’s work starts to grow beyond what was originally agreed upon during the initiation phase. Scope creep can put stress on you, your team, and your organization, and it can put your project at risk. The effects of scope creep can hinder every aspect of the project, from the schedule to the budget to the resources, and ultimately, its overall success.

Here are some best practices for scope management and controlling scope creep:

-   **Define your project’s requirements.** Communicate with your stakeholders or customers to find out exactly what they want from the project and document those requirements during the initiation phase.
    
-   **Set a clear project schedule.** Time and task management are essential for sticking to your project’s scope. Your schedule should outline all of your project’s requirements and the tasks that are necessary to achieve them.
    
-   **Determine what is out of scope.** Make sure your stakeholders, customers, and project team understand when proposed changes are out of scope. Come to a clear agreement about the potential impacts to the project and document your agreement.
-   **Provide alternatives.** Suggest alternative solutions to your customer or stakeholder. You can also help them consider how their proposed changes might create additional risks. Perform a cost-benefit analysis, if necessary.
-   **Set up a change control process.** During the course of your project, some changes are inevitable. Determine the process for how each change will be defined, reviewed, and approved (or rejected) before you add it to your project plan. Make sure your project team is aware of this process.
-   **Learn how to say no.** Sometimes you will have to say no to proposed changes. Saying no to a key stakeholder or customer can be uncomfortable, but it can be necessary to protect your project’s scope and its overall quality. If you are asked to take on additional tasks, explain how they will interfere with the budget, timeline, and/or resources defined in your initial project requirements.
-   **Collect costs for out-of-scope work.** If out-of-scope work is required, be sure to  document all costs incurred. That includes costs for work indirectly impacted by the increased scope. Be sure to indicate what the charges are for.

## Success criteria
Launching your project to the client can be a very big moment for you.
 You handed over the project to your client and now you can take a step back and breathe. 
 But make sure you land your project, as well. Look over your notes, talk with your team, meet with the client, and remember to return to your intended deliverables and metrics to help you measure success.

-   Success criteria are the standards to measure whether the project has met the goals and deliverables, which will be judged after delivering it to the stakeholders and customers.
	-   Success criteria should be defined well so that all teams understand what they must accomplish.
	-   Go through the project goals and deliverables, review the scope, and identify the measurable aspects of the project to know when the project is successfully accomplished.
	-   Clarify the project requirements and expectations with the stakeholders.
	-   Document and share all information so that everyone can refer to it later.
	-   Choose metrics that closely align with the project goal to measure success throughout the life cycle of the project.
	-   Pick the most suitable tool to collect the required data and track the metrics.
	-   Pick the best methods that work for the success criteria to measure success, frequency of measurement, and the persons who measure it.
-   Share the success criteria document with the stakeholders and ask whether they agree with it so that everyone understands each person's responsibility.
-   The document should be accessible throughout the duration of the project.

### Using OKRs to evaluate progress
OKRs can help you define and measure your project’s success criteria. In order for OKRs to be used to effectively meet
your project’s success criteria, it’s important to:

 - share them with your team
 -  assign owners to each key result to ensure
   accountability
   - measure your OKRs’ progress by scoring them
   - track your OKRs’ progress by scheduling regular check-ins with your team.

## Resources
### Team

 - Roles 
 - Team size
 - Skills 
 - Availability 
 - Motivation

### Roles
- ** Project manager** is responsible for the overall success of the team, and ultimately, the project as a whole. 
- **Project sponsor** is the person who is accountable for the project and who ensures the project delivers the agreed upon value to the business.(director of product)
- **Team members** are the heart of the operation.
They're the people doing the day to day work and making the project happen.
- **The customers** are the people who will get some sort of value from a successfully.You can think of them as the buyers of the project.

Roles selections
-   Who were the members of your team?
-   Which role (or roles) did each person fill?
-   Were project roles formally assigned or informally filled?
-   What role did you play?
-   How did each project role help or hinder the project’s outcome?

 #### Stakeholders
-   The primary ones benefit directly from the project.
-   The secondary ones are indirectly impacted.
-   Primary and secondary stakeholders help define the goals and outcomes.

**Suggested questions for stakeholders**

-   What are your most important priorities/goals?
-   How will this initiative/project support you and your most important priorities?
-   What role would you like to play within this initiative/project?
-   Here’s how I plan to keep people informed; does that work for you?
-   What can I clarify for you?
-   What are your expectations? What would you like for the project to accomplish?
-   What would success look like for you?
-   Who else do you recommend I reach out to about this initiative?
-   What information or insights do you have that might be challenging for me to find?
-   Where do you see me getting support for this initiative? Facing resistance?
-   What additional thoughts/questions do you have?

#### RACI
![enter image description here](https://github.com/Rayveni/blog/blob/main/articles/project_initiation/img/raci.jpg?raw=true)

 A RACI (**R**esponsible,  **A**ccountable,  **C**onsulted,  **I**nformed) chart describes the roles and responsibilities for team members.
Types of participation in a RACI chart:
-   **Responsible**- doing the work to complete the task
-   **Accountable**- ensuring that the work gets done
-   **Consulted**- giving feedback
-   **Informed**- just needing to know the final decisions.

Steps for creating a RACI chart:
-   The roles or people's names are written in the top row.
-   The tasks or deliverables are written in the left column.
-   Match the role or name with each task or deliverable and assign R, A, C, or I in the intersection box.
-   Because accountable indicates ownership, then, accountable has only one designated person.
-   The same person can be accountable and responsible.

Doing a RACI early on will prevent issues due to role confusion. This will ensure the success of the project.
## Resources
-   **Team**: the cost of the people performing the work
-   **Services**: any outside vendors helping your project
-   **Materials**: any tangible items purchased to complete the project
## Documentation
Two types of documentation track details and keep your stakeholders informed: **project proposal** and **project charter**.
-   A proposal helps in understanding the goals and impacts; a charter helps in getting organized and set-up plans.
-   A proposal comes at the beginning; a charter comes at the end of the initiation phase.
-   A proposal is used only at the earlier stages; a charter is the reference throughout the project's life.
-   A proposal persuades the stakeholders to perform the project; a charter defines the project details to reach its goal.
-   A proposal can be formal or informal; a charter is a formal document.
-   A charter contains all information about the benefits (values, money, and time).
-   The project charter approval means that the project management supports it, and the project can be performed.

The project manager reviews and develops the charter, adapting to its audiences and the stakeholders' needs throughout the process.

**project charter** clearly defines the project and outlines the necessary details for the project to reach its goals. 
![enter image description here](https://github.com/Rayveni/blog/blob/main/articles/project_initiation/img/charter.jpg?raw=true)
The charter is the formal way that the project’s goals, values, benefits, and details are captured. You can think of the charter as the compass for your project since  you will use it throughout the life cycle of the project. Many stakeholders will look to your project charter to ensure that you are indeed aligned with strategic goals and set up for achieving the desired end goal. Since the project charter carries so much importance, it is important to incorporate the right amount of detail while omitting miscellaneous elements.

Project charters will vary but usually include some combination of the following key information:
 -   introduction/project summary
 -   goals/objectives
 -   business case/benefits and costs
 -   project team
 -   scope
 -   success criteria
 -   major requirements or key deliverables
 -   budget
 -   schedule/timeline or milestones
 -   constraints and assumptions
 -   risks
 -   OKRs
 -   approvals
