## Intro
How to find a way in challenging situations/decision-making /problem-solving situations? 
The Cynefin framework, a sense-making model created by Dave Snowden,could give you some orientation.
## Domains
### Confusion
There is no clarity about which of the other domains apply (this domain has also been known as _disordered_ in earlier versions of the framework). By definition it is hard to see when this domain applies. "Here, multiple perspectives jostle for prominence, factional leaders argue with one another, and cacophony rules", write Snowden and Boone. "The way out of this realm is to break down the situation into constituent parts and assign each to one of the other four realms. 
**Sum up:**
-   The purpose of the framework is to get out of this zone;
-   Define what domain you are in;
-   Choose the right tactic;
### Chaotic
In the  _chaotic_  domain, cause and effect are unclear.Events in this domain are "too confusing to wait for a knowledge-based response". 
An experimental strategy works well. Unsolved, completely novel tasks that are chaotic in nature.
**Goals:**
 - System stablisation or order establishing  (sense where stability is present and from where it is absent)
 -  Communication: the most direct top-down or broadcast kind is imperative; there’s simply no time to ask for input
  
**Decision-making formula:**  act–sense(establish the facts)–respond.
**Example:**  startup.  
**Method:**  novel.
### Complex
The _complex_ domain represents the "unknown unknowns". Cause and effect can only be deduced in retrospect, and there are no right answers.
**Goals:**
- Conduct experiments.
- Approach take-it-apart-and-see-how-it-works, because your very actions change the situation in unpredictable ways.

**Decision-making formula:**  probe–sense–respond.
**Example:**  battlefields, markets, ecosystems and corporate cultures.  
**Method:**  Experiments.
### Complicated
The _complicated_ domain consists of the "known unknowns". The relationship between cause and effect requires analysis or expertise; there are a range of right answers. 
**Goals:**
- Carefully(small steps/parts) move to Clear domain.

**Decision-making formula:**  sense–analyze–respond.
**Example:**  Chess playing(looking at every possible sequence of moves).  
**Method:**  Good Practice.

### Clear
The _clear_ domain represents the "known knowns". This means that there are rules in place, the situation is stable, and the relationship between cause and effect is clear: if you do X, expect Y.  An employee identifies the problem (for example, a borrower has paid less than required), categorizes it (reviews the loan documents), and responds (follows the terms of the loan).

When success breeds complacency ("best practice is, by definition, past practice"), there can be a catastrophic clockwise shift into the chaotic domain. They recommend that leaders provide a communication channel, if necessary an anonymous one, so that dissenters (for example, within a workforce) can warn about complacency.
**Goals:**
-  Establish communication channel (if necessary anonymous one) to avoid  clockwise shift into the chaotic domain
**Decision-making formula:**  sense–categorize–respond.
**Example:**   chairs production.  
**Method:**  best practices.

## Domain boundaries
The boundary between simple and chaotic systems is marked by maximum risks. When you are in clear domain, you begin to believe that the experience and knowledge gained is the key to success in any system, which is not true.

This plunges the system into a crisis. Remain as much as possible in complex or complicated domains, and move  only a small number of workflows and tasks to a clear domain.

## How to apply cynefin framework
 1. Contextualization.
 2. Define which domain your context refers to.
 3. Choose a behaviour pattern.
 4. Choose the  proper tools.
## Contextualization  
Let's consider how to deal multiple dimensions  and how  transform multiple dimensions into one (to simplify).
### Project management example
In general, we have the following project areas:
![enter image description here](https://github.com/Rayveni/blog/blob/main/articles/Problem%20solving%20framework/options.gif?raw=true)

**First**, use Cynefine to set the domain to which each area belongs:
![enter image description here](https://github.com/Rayveni/blog/blob/main/articles/Problem%20solving%20framework/state1.jpg?raw=true)
 The same contextualization/categorization routine should be followed regularly.

For instance, the situation might change or "normalize" during the project, e.g.:
![enter image description here](https://github.com/Rayveni/blog/blob/main/articles/Problem%20solving%20framework/state2.jpg?raw=true)
### User Story example
Let's show off how to use the Cynefin framework to negotiate meaning between the **Client** and **Capability** (represented by the delivering organization’s knowledge, skills and capacity) contexts when working on a new project.

Writing down the user stories that will be delivered on hexagon cards is the first step in developing a contextualized Cynefin framework.
At **first step** ,when creating a **contextualized** Cynefin framework, write down on cards the user stories.Then the cards are positioned relative to each domain of the Cynefin space – without boundaries.  This can be done in person or electronically – but must be done socially. Discussion is encouraged while placing the cards.

In following example  only three cases used:
1.  The client knows exactly what they need. They have it already defined. (Obvious)
2.  The client knows what they need but not exactly. They’ll need some expert analysis in order to define it. (Complicated)
3.  The client has just a vague idea about what they need. They’ll have to explore several alternatives before arriving at a definition. (Complex)

The uncertainty about if our development capability would match the requirements defines the Cynefin domains for the Capability’s context. Again three cases:

1.  We have all the knowledge and skills required to do the job. (Obvious)
2.  We have some of the knowledge and skills required to do the job. The rest we’ll research and analyze because someone somewhere has done it before. (Complicated)
3.  We have none of the knowledge and skills required to do the job. We haven’t done it before and we’ll need to explore alternatives and build knowledge. (Complex)

Highlight user stories using the matrix above:
![enter image description here](https://github.com/Rayveni/blog/blob/main/articles/Problem%20solving%20framework/user_story.jpg?raw=true)

(Low,Medium,High) -> (Clear,Complicated,Complex)
**Note**:
 1. In a complex system every intervention changes the thing observed. The agents and the system coevolve. Hence the initial categorization of the initial set of user stories is likely to change as we work through the project.
 2.  The same contextualization/categorization routine should be followed whenever new user stories added to the project scope.

## Another point of view on Cynefin

The main idea of Cenefin that we dealing with constraints (that can change or be changing through the time).
Lets consider a factory and related situations:

 1. Get an order to produce 100 details ,we have already proper assembly line and matherials.It's **clear** domain  for us , and **operational management** is best here( check-lists,rigid reglament)
 2. Get an order to produce 100 details ,have neither workshop&line nor experience with such kind details.For us it's complecated domain.The first issue for  us is to build workshop&line. For e.g. we can use agile methods and accomplish it in 9 moth.But on the other hand on market could be a complany which specialisates on workshops building and complete this issue in 3 months. For this company it would be operational activity(clear domain)  while for us it would be complecated domain.Same issue, but different domains.

**Conclusion**: the more expertise you have , the less agile approaches needed, the close you to operational methods.

For example Apple company  practice agile in engineering  operations(new devices designing). And after new device  designed, manufactoring transfered to China(rigid qulity contol and check-lists)
